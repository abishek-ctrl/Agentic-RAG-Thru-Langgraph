# Langchain Based LLM Project

## Overview

This is a simple Langchain-based LLM project that allows users to upload multiple documents and ask questions through a web UI. The LLM has access to the knowledge contained within the uploaded documents and can provide answers to user's questions. This project can be improved in the future by creating a more user-friendly interface and enhancing its academic capabilities.

## Features

The following features are currently available in this project:

- Users can upload multiple PDF documents through the web UI.
- Users can ask questions related to the content of the uploaded documents.
- The LLM uses natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to understand and interpret user questions.
- The LLM provides answers to user questions based on the information contained within the uploaded documents.
- The LLM retains knowledge of past messages and documents to provide more accurate responses.
